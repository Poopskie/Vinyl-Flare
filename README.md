# Vinyl-Flare

WPF app that simulates a vinyl player, and allows users to make albums 

First WPF application I have made, passion project for myself



Inspired by the fact that I can't afford a Vinyl Player and love good albums

<i>oh yea, I also can't afford spotify premium thats why</i>

# Use
Top right button to fullscreen
- Select Album you want to play in Library
- Create Albums in Factory
  - Select Image
  - Add Songs
  - Reorder Songs
- Listen to music!
